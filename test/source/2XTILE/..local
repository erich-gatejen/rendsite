# Property file.  The Rules:
# - Each property is a name/value pair, separated by a equal sign.  The name should be DNS characters only (letters, numbers, dot).
# - Comment lines start with a # and are ignored.
# - Blank lines (all whitespace) are ignored.
# - Lines can be continued with an amperstand character '&' as the last character.
# - Every line will be trimmed of whitespace at both ends, but intra-token whitespace will be preserved.
# - A single property can have multiple values.  Each value is separated with a comma (',').
# - The escape character is ?.  A double '??' will yield a single '?'.
# - The , may be escaped with ?, as can the equal sign.
# - It is assumed to be the default character set.

description=XTILE is fast, full-feature VGA driver hand written in Assembler.  It has support for sprites, a mouse and fonts.  It &
is intended to be used by a C or C++ program.  There are three versions--1.0, 2.0, and 2.1.  Version 1.0 was a shareware &
release that expected payment for commercial usage or the source code.  Version 2.0 included split screen, a mouse driver, and &
other new features.  It was to be a commercial-only release, but I sent a copy to all the registered shareware customers.  It seemed only &
right.  For 2.1, I had to add 386 support to a few functions, as well as an adapted scaled-bitmap routine, so I could complete &
a sale.  On top of a few bug fixes, this was the final version, and it was used in some commercial games, as well some personal &
projects, such as the REVERSEM game.  I completed documentation only for the 1.0, since none of my commercial customers asked for &
new documentation for 2.X (they did get my personal support).
